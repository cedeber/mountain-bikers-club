## Contributing to the code
- The `main` branch is the currently released code running on mountainbikers.club.
  All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against
  the `master` branch.**
- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `develop`, and merge back
  against that branch.
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the Pull Request - we will
  let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.
- If adding new feature, provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally
  you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.
- If fixing a bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxx[,#xxx])` (#xxx is the issue id)
    in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.
  
##  Before Submitting A Bug Report
- Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported.
  If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead
  of opening a new one.
